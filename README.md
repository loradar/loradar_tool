![Overview of LoRaWAN communication and breakdown of LoRadar (Version 1)](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1_DZtQ1pf7xVO5VPIY57kWERC9kML--kG)

LoRadar is a passive packet sniffing framework for LoRa built using off-the-shelf hardware. Unlike standard LoRaWAN gateways that relay the received LoRaWAN packets to the network server, LoRdar does not relay the received messages and is in essence an offline LoRaWAN gateway. This provides the benefit of not interfering with the existing network, such as changing the flow of the uplink and downlink packet transmissions.
